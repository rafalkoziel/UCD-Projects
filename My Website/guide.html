					<h2>What is volleyball?</h2>
					<p>This is only a very basic introduction to volleyball to give You a general idea about volleyball. If you already know basics
					then join us during one of the training sessions to learn more and improve your skills ;) .</p>
					<p>So volleyball is a team sport in which two teams are separated by a net. Each team can score a point by grounding a ball
						on the opposing side of the net, given that no rules were broken. Each team consists of 6 players and a libero. Each match 
						is played in either best of 5 or best of 3 formula. Each set is played up to 25 points where a team has to win with 2 points difference.</p>
					<p>Each action starts by a player serving a ball over a net. The opposing team can touch the ball only 3 times and each player can only touch it once.
					Ideal action consists of pass (recieving the ball),set (setting the ball to person who is attacking) and a hit. If ball touches the ground the team who hit the ball gets a point.</p>
					<p> Well that's pretty much all you need to know to start playing!<br>If the theory doesn't sound good to you, why don't you watch some volleyball in action?
